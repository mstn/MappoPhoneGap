# MappoPhoneGap [deprecated]

Quick and dirty test I put together some years ago.

It is based on [meteor-ddp](https://github.com/eddiefloreslive/meteor-ddp) and 
the code skeleton seems to have been generated with some cordova tool.

Probably, I was playing around with Meteor+mobile and this repo was intended as a throw-away project for self-teaching purposes only.
I forgot about its existence and I do not remember if I followed a tutorial or I built it on my own (it looks like quite standard and trivial stuff).
If you know anything, get in touch and I will add more credits (and sorry about that!).

It should not work anymore. 
Today, there are better ways to build mobile apps and meteor is now [fully integrated](https://guide.meteor.com/mobile.html#introduction) with cordova.
